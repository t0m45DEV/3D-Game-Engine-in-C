# 3D Game Engine using C

A 3D Game Engine entirely made with C. More like a "can I do this?" project than a "that's a fun idea for a game" project.

The games it can make are similar to Wolfenstein, using raycasting to fake a 3D environment, but it's really just a 2D plane.

## Controls

You can move forward and backward with W and S, respectively. To rotate left or right you use A and D.

## Instalation

To install just download the executable from this git, or download the whole project and run:

```
make
```

to create a new executable. Then, in the same folder run:

```
./scape
```

and the game should start.
