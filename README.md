# Scape

A 3D Game entirely made with C. More like a "can I do this?" project than a "that's a fun idea for a game" project.

The game is similar to Wolfenstein, using raytracing to fake a 3D environment, but it's really just a 2D plane.

The idea for the game itself it's pretty simple: you are in a labyrinth, and there is a monster trying to catch you. If it does, you loose, if you scape, you win.

## Controls

You can move forward and backward with W and S, respectively. To rotate left or right you use A and D.

## Instalation

To install just download the executable from this git, or download the whole project and run:

```
make
```

to create a new executable. Then, in the same folder run:

```
./scape
```

and the game should start.
